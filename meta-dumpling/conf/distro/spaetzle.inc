# Attention: poky-tiny has a hard assignment:
# PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto-tiny"
# this will break our boards, preventing to use own kernel recipes, branches
# etc. To workaround this, store the value before inclusion, unset after
# inclusion and weak assign after inclusion. This allows all sort of reassignment
# from distro or environment and leaves the default.
