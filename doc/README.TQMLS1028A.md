# TQMLS1017A / TQMLS1028A

## Notes

Differing from the LS1028A defaults, the TQMLS1028A device trees use an
external sensor IC (connected to a measurement diode inside the SoC)
instead of the builtin TMU as their primary data source for CPU core
temperature. The external IC features a greater measurement range and
higher precision.

The sensor is used for automatic core clock reduction and shutdown in the
case of overheating.
